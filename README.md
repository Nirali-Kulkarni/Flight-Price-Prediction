# Flight-Price-Prediction
Utilized flight data from Kaggle as the dataset for analysis.
Initiated data preprocessing, including data cleaning, treating null values, and converting categorical variables into numerical values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted EDA to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and relationships.
Employed various charts and visualizations to analyze the data effectively.
Model Development:

Implemented a Random Forest model for predictive analysis.
Utilized Randomized Search CV to optimize model hyperparameters, ensuring the best possible model performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as metrics.
Model Performance:

Achieved an R-squared (r2) score of 81%, indicating a strong predictive capability of the model.
Deployment on AWS:

Deployed the trained model to Amazon Web Services (AWS) by creating an EC2 instance, making the model accessible for real-time predictions and usage.
